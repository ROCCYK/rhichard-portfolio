      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome! My name is Rhichard Koh. I am from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
        During my senior year of high school I was introduced to trading, I then
        quickly got interested in trading currency because of the high leverage
        and earning potential. After graduating high school I attended Online
        Trading Academy to properly learn how to trade with proper risk
        management, technical analysis, as well as fundamental analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        After quickly learning the concepts, the instructors noticed and offered
        me the role of becoming a Student Support Specialist. I accepted the
        offer and helped teach the students proper risk management, technical
        analysis, and fundamental analysis. I got to meet many hedge fund
        traders, independent traders, and institutional traders. They informed
        me about where trading is going in the near future and introduced me to
        quantitive trading.
      </p>
      <p>
        I became interested in becoming a quantitive trader. Diving into that
        topic I learned about machine learning and deep learning and I got
        passionate about learning about artificial intelligence. I am now in
        Durham College for Honours Bachelor’s of Artificial Intelligence,
        aspiring to become a machine learning engineer.
